# TeenBuddy

This is a group project of CSC444 Software Engineering course at University of Toronto.
We are a group of six students creating a website that supports the users to book and post their jobs.
Shareholders are the teenagers that willing to provide some basic help and adults that need someone to do some simple jobs. (including yark working, dog walking and etc.)

My personal work on this project mainly focus on the Job posting, including the Job markets page and personal jobs. I have also worked on the credit part of the website.
